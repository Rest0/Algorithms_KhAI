Algorithms_KhAI
===============

Here we will keep all the materials and references from KhAI trainings. 

The rules are the following:

1) Lectures and materials - separate folders in repository.

2) Homework descriptions - separate Wiki pages.

3) Post questions - in issue tracking system.

Sport programming is the best!
